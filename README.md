# PoC ( Proof  of concept ) of a remote control for cursor or any terminal window.

A Reddit user asked about controlling the cursor using a mobile device, and I replied: "Maybe I'm taking a dump and want the cursor to leave a summary of what I was doing for when I get back from the bathroom."

And suppose you want to get a coffee but need to run an rsync on your server, or maybe you just want to ask the agent cursor to create a to-do list for your project before you get back to your computer, then maybe this 30-minute Cursor prompt project would be interesting.

Thanks to the random user from Reddit that inspire me to do this.
